            <h3> List of Demands </h3>
            The CU Boulder Women and Gender Studies Senior Class Colloquium, the “Cottage Killjoys,” has come together to demand real, 
            tangible change in administration's response to and handling of rape culture and sexual assault on and around 
            University of Colorado's campuses. Stagnation and unresponsiveness from the school's higher up administration 
            to sexual violence experienced by students must be changed. We as students will not stand for sexual violence and 
            rape culture at the University of Colorado Boulder, and WILL continue to demand action until change is seen.
            <ol>
                <li> We demand that all freshman students at CU Boulder must attend a sexual assault orientation, in person. 
                    This orientation must be focused on educating men to not engage in predatory behavior and to hold peers accountable, 
                    rather than preventative measures that are aimed at potential victims.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand that a sexual assault and bystander intervention training be required each year of college, 
                    particularly one that concept-builds off of the last training, NOT identically repeating the same trainings. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand that ALL allegations of sexual assault are taken seriously, 
                    and followed through to the end, <em>promptly</em>, by administrators and law enforcement agencies. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand more in depth investigations of prospective students to ensure that any persons with 
                    any history of sexual assault cannot be enrolled in the University of Colorado Boulder. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand an emphasis on action, consequences, and restorative justice for offenders of sexual violence.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand that the CU Alert systems identify sexual assault patterns within communities that are near the universities, 
                    and to notify people in a timely manner, REGARDLESS of jurisdiction, for the purpose of keeping students, 
                    <em>a targeted population</em>, aware and safe while they are on campus OR in the community. 
                    Especially focusing on incidents that occur within Greek Life. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand that the university works with the Interfraternal Council (IFC) in order to hold fraternities accountable 
                    for sexual assault, drugging, and other allegations, rather than ignorance of the largest population of perpetrators. 
                    We would like to see action over simple surveillance of the organization. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand there is stronger communication to the students on the participation in the Campus Culture Survey to gather 
                    more accurate information of the sexual misconduct on campus. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We demand that any release of sexual misconduct statistics includes an acknowledgement of the mass underreporting of sexual 
                    misconduct and why people are deterred from reporting these instances. 
                </li>
