            Welcome to the website for the Women and Gender Studies Colloquium of the Class of 2023!
            We are a group of Women and Gender Studies students at the University of Colorado - Boulder seeking to bring an end to campus gender-based violence and sexual assault.
            To accomplish this, we created a community project dedicated to remembering our collective feminist histories and addressing gender-based violence and sexual assault,
            especially as it is perpetuated by Greek Life and the lack of adequate response by campus administration. Our project includes three major portions: The Public-Facing Address, The Archive, 
            and Rupture and Disturbance. On this website, you can find our <a href="manifesto.html"><b>Manifesto</b></a> which details our goals and demands for the university as well as our philosophy as 
            feminist scholars. Additionally, we have <a href="resources.html"><b>Resources</b></a> for information about gender-based violence and sexual assault on campus and ways to receive support.
            If you are interested in feminist histories, check out the <a href="archive.html"><b>Archive</b></a> where we have chronicled Boulder feminist stories and histories.
